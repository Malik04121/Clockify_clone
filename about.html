      <p>What is Clockify</p>
      <p>

        teams of all sizes. Unlike all the other time trackers, Clockify lets
        you have an unlimited number of users for free. Clockify is an online
        app that works in a browser, but you can also install it on your
        computer or phone for convenience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clockify is used by everyone from freelancers, small businesses, and
        consulting agencies, to government institutions, NGOs, universities, and
        Fortune 500 companies.

      <p>Our story</p>
      <p class="inq">
        Clockify was officially launched in 2017. Back then, we were charging
        clients by the hour, so we needed to know how much time we were spending
        on projects and our whole team needed to track time. Nothing fancy or
        intrusive. We just needed a record of how much time a certain project
        took in a certain month, and how much we need to bill clients.
      </p>
      <p class="inq">
        One day, we got an email from the company whose time tracker we were
        using. The email was notifying us that, starting next month, our monthly
        bill would increase from $500 to $1,000. Even before that we felt that
        we were overpaying the tool, and this new price was simply too much. At
        that moment, we decided to look for an alternative.
      </p>
      <p class="inq">
        We started searching for another solution, but all the time tracking
        apps on the market were either too complicated or too expensive -
        especially for bigger teams, like ours.
      </p>
      <p class="inq">
        So, we decided to create our own time tracker and offer it to anyone for
        absolutely free. Why? We know that each dollar counts when you're a
        startup and we believe every team should be able to track time without
        having to pay a fortune.
      </p>
      <p class="inq">
        In the meantime, a lot of people started using Clockify and we started
        receiving a ton of feature requests. So, we've decided to invest further
        into Clockify's development and completely focus on building products.
        We've added a ton of extra features, and started charging for them to
        teams that needed more.

      <p>How we keep Clockify free</p>
      <p class="free">
        The #1 question we receive all the time is: "How do you make money if
        the service is free? What's the catch?"
      </p>
      <p class="free">
        Short answer: we have paid plans that have additional features aimed
        towards professionals.
      </p>
      <p class="free">
        When something good is offered for free, like Clockify, it usually comes
        with a hidden price - most usually it's privacy, something tech industry
        is notorious for. That's not the case with Clockify.
      </p>
      <p class="free">
        We never sell or share any data with anyone. Why? Because we don't have
        to. We don't have investors or shareholders hungry for profit, so we
        don't face pressure to make a quick buck by any means necessary. We are
        completely independent and free to always do the right thing.
      </p>
      <p class="free">
        How can we afford this? First, we make Clockify accessible to everyone,
        and then we provide even more value to those on a paid subscription:
      </p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li class="free1">
            The basic version is free, so anyone can easily get started. This
            lets us make time tracking accessible to everyone.
          </li>
          <li class="free1">
            Some teams decide to upgrade to a paid plan so they can access extra
            features, like scheduling and time off tracking.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="free">
        This structure lets us democratize time tracking for everyone, without
        ever needing to make a profit at a cost of someone's privacy. We hope
        you enjoy using Clockify as much as we enjoy developing it. If you have
        any questions or feedback, send us an email - we always love to hear
        from our users!
