## About this project: üôå

> We worked on cloning a Clockify website. Clockify is a time tracker and timesheet app that lets you track work hours across projects. In this project, we used React JS, Node js, Express Js, MongoDB, Styled-components, bootstrap, and CSS. which we have merged by using GITHUB. Our project is dynamic and responsive in work.
> This is a team project, built by us in the Construct Week - Unit 3 at Masai School.
