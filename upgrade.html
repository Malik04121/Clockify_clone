                      <h3>Are there any limits in the free plan?</h3>
                      <p>You can track as much time and invite as many users as you want, and use Clockify for free as long as you want. We also offer support to everyone, regardless of their plan. If you need additional features, you can UPGRADE at any time.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                      <h3>Can I try out the paid features?</h3>
                      <p>Absolutely! You can try out all PRO features for free for 7 days, no credit card required. You can <a style="color:#03a9f4;" rel="nofollow" href="https://app.clockify.me/UPGRADE?freeTrial=true">activate the free trial</a> on the UPGRADE page.

                      <h3>What is a seat?</h3>
                      <p>Each active user requires a paid seat. If you deactivate some user, you free up their paid seat so you can invite a new user. If you buy another seat mid-cycle, you'll be charged a prorated price for that billing cycle.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-item">
                      <h3>Are there any additional taxes?</h3>
                      <p>No, we take care of all the taxes. The price you see is what you'll get charged in the end. You can enter your VAT number, but it will only be used as an additional piece of information displayed on your invoices.</p>

                      <h3>How does canceling work?</h3>
                      <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time in just a couple of clicks on the UPGRADE page. Once you cancel and the current subscription expires, you will be downgraded to the free version and no further charges will be made. You won't lose any data (canceling only affects access to the extra features).</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">

                      <p>We don't offer refunds. But, if you were mistakenly charged due to system error, contact us and we'll immediately issue you a refund. If you wish to test extra features, we recommend activating the <a style="color:#03a9f4;" href="https://app.clockify.me/UPGRADE?freeTrial=true">free 7-day trial</a> first, BEFORE making any payment.</p>

                      <h3>How does kiosk pricing work?</h3>
                      <p>If you use the kiosk mode, you can add limited users and pay a separate lower price for them. Limited users can only use Clockify via the kiosk you open. You can transform them to full users by adding their email so they can access the rest of Clockify.</p>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                      <h3>How does yearly pricing work?</h3>
                      <p>You prepay a seat for the whole year in advance and get 20% OFF. If you add another seat midway, you pay a prorated price for the rest of the year. If you need someone for just a brief period, you can deactivate them later to free up their paid seat for someone else.</p>

            HIDE TIME & PAGES
          </p>
          <h3>Prevent users from seeing everything</h3>
          <p>Usually, people in your workspace can see everyone's time entries. But you can limit their access and hide them completely so each regular user on the workspace can only view their own entries.</p>
          <p>You can also hide pages from the sidebar that others don't need. In case you have a lot of contractors, you can hide the Team page so people don't see other members, or hide Projects and Reports so people can focus just on tracking time.</p>

          <p>REQUIRED FIELDS</p>
          <h3>Prevent incomplete time entries</h3>
          <p>Make your most important fields required so no one can create entries with missing information (like details of what was done). Once entries are properly categorized, you'll no longer have to spend hours fixing other people's timesheets.</p>

          <h3>Clean up your reports</h3>
          <p>Find all uncategorized entries or entries that are suspiciously short/long, and fix them. Once everything is properly labeled and cleaned up, you can lock them and share the report with clients.</p>

          <h3>Update all your past hourly rates</h3>
          <p>When you change an hourly rate, you can choose if the new rate applies to only newly create time entries from now on, if you wish to overwrite previous rate on existing time entries, or if you wish apply the new rate from a certain date forward.</p>

          <h3>Update multiple entries and projects</h3>
          <p>Select all the time entries or projects you wish to update, and then edit their properties. Perfect for record keeping, like when you need to mark entries as invoiced, move them to a different project, mark projects as private, etc.</p>

          <p>DECIMAL FORMAT</p>
          <h3>See and export time in decimal format</h3>
          <p>Switch to decimal duration format, and all time will be displayed and exported in decimals (instead of the clock format).

            Also, if you type a single digit in a timesheet cell, it will be treated as hour (eg. if you type 1, it will be transformed to 1h).</p>

          <p>ADD TIME FOR OTHERS</p>
          <h3>Log time on behalf of your team</h3>
          <p>Add time on other people's behalf right from the report. You can add time either for a single user, or for a whole group at once. Or alternatively, switch to your teammate's timesheet and quickly populate their timesheet for them. This way, you'll no longer have to wait for someone to add the missing time.</p>

          <p>PROJECT TEMPLATES</p>
          <h3>Set up a lot of identical projects</h3>
          <p>Once you have a project with tasks set up, set it as a template. Then, every time you create a new project, you'll be able select the template and have all the tasks and settings copied over to the new project. Perfect if you have a lot of similar projects for different clients.</p>

          <p>PIN & BREAK</p>
          <h3>Clock in with PIN and take breaks</h3>
          <p>When clocking in and out via the kiosk, require employees to sign in with their personal 4-digit PIN code. You can also clock in for others using the kiosk's secret Universal PIN code/

            You can also create multiple kiosks for different locations, plus have the same one open on multiple devices simultaneously.
            
            You can enable breaks, so people can take a break while clocked in and track how much time they spend on breaks.</p>
